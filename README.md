### [An Integrated Architecture for Maintaining Security in Cloud Computing Based on Blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420703)

This paper presents a robust and innovative architecture that integrates **blockchain technology** with **cloud computing** to provide enhanced security and trust in data storage and processing. With the rapid growth of cloud services, ensuring **data confidentiality, integrity, and availability** has become increasingly critical. Traditional centralized cloud systems are often prone to single points of failure and vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access, data tampering, and insider threats.

To address these issues, the authors propose a **decentralized framework** where:

- ✔️ **Blockchain** is utilized to store master hash values of cloud data, ensuring that any unauthorized changes to the data can be easily detected.
- ✔️ **Homomorphic encryption** allows data to be processed in encrypted form, maintaining confidentiality even during computation.
- ✔️ A **Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism** is implemented among Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to ensure that the network remains secure and reliable, even if some nodes act maliciously or fail.
- ✔️ The system leverages **public blockchains** (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) to achieve transparent and tamper-evident logging of data changes and verification.

This integrated architecture allows for **secure outsourcing of data**, where users can confidently rely on cloud service providers without the need to fully trust them. The use of blockchain ensures that trust is established through transparent, cryptographic mechanisms rather than centralized authority.
