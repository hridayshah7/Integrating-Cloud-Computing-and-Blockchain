To explore how blockchain can enhance cloud computing security, refer to the following research paper:

**[An Integrated Architecture for Maintaining Security in Cloud Computing Based on Blockchain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420703)**  
This paper proposes a secure architecture that integrates blockchain technology with cloud computing to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and decentralized control. It leverages homomorphic encryption and Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus among cloud service providers, while using public blockchains (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) to maintain tamper-proof hash records of data.
